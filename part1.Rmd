# Welcome to UniBound Stats Lab!

You made it! Thanks for setting up the RStudio Cloud account.

# Part 1: Orientation

## What is this?
The file you currently have open is a type of file called a 'Markdown' file. It's a great system for running code alongside writing text.

## Try running some simple code
The grey box you can see below is where you can write and run R code. It is called a "chunk". There is some simple code in the chunk below.

Read through the code and predict what it will do.

Press the green arrow/go button on the top right of the box. You'll see the output appear below the chunk.

```{r simple-example}
# print() will just return the text inside the quote marks
print("Stats is so cool")

# "Hello world!" is a common first programming exercise!
print("Hello world!") 

# These comments after the "#" are not read by the computer, they are comments just for humans and help explain what is going on in your code. A good habit to get into!

# You can do maths in R - Liza uses this for everything. 

# You can do the calculation directly...
3 + 7

# ...or you can store it as something and use it again later
do_maths = 3 + 7
do_maths

```

Congratulations, you're finished orientation. Click "Part 2: Harry Potter Fanfiction" in the files pane on the right.
